# What is Naive Bayes Machine Learning Algorithm?

✅  Naïve Bayes is a probabilistic machine learning algorithm, which means it predicts based on the probability of an object.
✅  It is based on the Bayes Theorem, used in a wide variety of classification tasks. It is mainly used in text classification.
✅  In Spite of having many advanced ML algorithms, Naïve Bayes Classifier is one of the simple and most effective Classification algorithms which helps in building the fast machine learning models that can make quick predictions.
✅  Naive Bayes assumes that all features are independent or unrelated and that’s why it cannot learn the relationship between the features.
